# 🏗️ System Architecture

VortexOps follows a unified full-stack architecture where the React frontend is bundled directly into the Spring Boot application. This approach eliminates cross-origin issues, simplifies deployment, and enables the entire platform to run behind a single HTTP endpoint.

Unlike traditional microservice-based dashboards that require multiple exposed ports, VortexOps packages the frontend and backend into one deployable artifact while PostgreSQL operates as an isolated database service within the Docker network.

# 🗄 Database Design

PostgreSQL serves as the persistent storage layer for telemetry records, diagnostic logs, simulated incidents, and historical system metrics.

### Primary Responsibilities

- Telemetry Storage
- Historical Metrics
- Incident Logs
- Configuration Records
- AI Diagnostic History

---

# 🐳 Docker Deployment Architecture

VortexOps is fully containerized using Docker Compose.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

A[Docker Compose]

A --> B[React + Spring Boot]

A --> C[PostgreSQL]

B --> C

B --> D[OpenRouter API]

User --> B
```

The application startup sequence is orchestrated to ensure database readiness before the backend initializes. Health checks prevent the application from attempting database connections before PostgreSQL becomes available.

---

# 📥 Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VortexOps.git

cd VortexOps
```

---

# ⚙️ Environment Configuration

Create an environment file or configure your environment variables before starting the application.

Example:

```env
# PostgreSQL

DB_HOST=postgres-db
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=vortexops_metrics_db
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# AI

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key

# Spring

SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod

SERVER_PORT=8080
```

Never commit API keys or passwords to version control.

---

# 🗄 Configure PostgreSQL

Create a PostgreSQL database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE vortexops_metrics_db;
```

Update the application configuration if using a different database name.

---

# 🏗 Build Backend

Compile the Spring Boot application.

```bash
cd backend

mvn clean install
```

Run the backend.

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The backend will start on

```
http://localhost:8080
```

---

# ⚛ Run Frontend

Move into the frontend directory.

```bash
cd frontend
```

Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Start development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

Default frontend

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

# 🐳 Docker Deployment

VortexOps has been designed for containerized deployment.

Simply execute

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Or in detached mode

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Docker will automatically

- Build the frontend
- Compile the backend
- Create PostgreSQL container
- Initialize the database
